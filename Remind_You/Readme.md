"Remind You" is a console app designed for generating formal text messages, ideal for notifying patients or customers about upcoming appointments. The application efficiently incorporates names and times into a predefined format, ensuring a professional and organized communication process.

I developed this software in my capacity as the individual responsible for orchestrating and managing appointments for the bishop within my local congregation. Given that a significant portion of these appointments involves a younger audience prone to overlooking their scheduled commitments, I have undertaken the task of sending timely reminder texts. Recognizing the escalating time demands associated with this responsibility, I sought to streamline and enhance efficiency by automating the reminder text generation process. This initiative is aimed at not only optimizing time management but also ensuring the continued effectiveness of appointment notifications within the scope of my responsibilities.
